In an attempt to preserve a cache of lightsabers, Master Ood Bnar\ninitiated his lifecycle change, becoming a gnarled old tree with the lightsabers engtangled in his roots.

By itself,\nAdarlon is a rugged, mountainous world originally settled by a group of Old Republic altruists - many from\nAlderaan - for its beauty rather than its resources. They were particularly well-funded, and their society\ngrew into one of entertainment rather than survival. It was on Adarlon that the holographic medium was\ndeveloped as an entertainment staple, and music from the planet is also highly sophisticated. Its primary\nindustry was centered around tourism, and its temperate climate was well-suited to the various resorts\nand parks which operated there. Adarlon has a day which lasts 21 standard hours, and a year which last\n381 local days. Adarlon was also the home to one of the most famous opera companies in the galaxy,\nand the famous opera singer Neile Janna was a native of Adarloon. (GG6, SWJ5)",
